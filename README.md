# coclicodata

This repository contains code to maintain the CoCliCo STAC catalog. Please note that
this is a **relative** STAC catalog for development purposes.

## Usage

Given that `coclicodata` is under active development, it's recommended to clone the repository and then install it in 'editable' mode. This way, any changes made to the package are immediately available without needing a reinstall.

Follow these steps for installation:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/openearth/coclicodata.git
   ```

2. **Install the environment**:

   ``` bash
   mamba env create -f /path/to/coclicodata/environment.yml
   ```

3. **Activate the environment**:

   ``` bash
   mamba activate coclico
   ```

4. **Install the package in editable mode**:

   ``` bash
   pip install -e /path/to/coclicodata
   ```

After installation, you can easily import and use any module or function from the
`coclicodata` package in your Python scripts or interactive sessions:

```python
from coclicodata.coclico_stac import utils
# Further code utilizing the utils module...
```

## Use pre-commit locally

Ensure consistent code formatting and avoid big repositories by removing output with pre-commit.

In the root of the repository run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

If the hooks catch issues when you commit your changes, they will fix them automatically.:

```bash
git commit -m "Your message"
```
Once hooks pass, push your changes.

## Test

You can run `pytest` to check whether you current STAC collection is valid. The command
will automatically run the test scripts that are maintained in `tests/test_*.py`

## Release

On successful validation of STAC catalog in the main branch, an **absolute** version
of the catalog will be published in the `live` branch that can be used externally.
