  "description": "\nCross-shore coastal transects are vital for coastal monitoring, serving as consistent\nreference lines to measure changes and analyze coastal characteristics. The Global Coastal T\nransect Repository (GCTR) builds on the Global Coastal Transect System (GCTS), which\ncomprises over 11 million transects uniformly spaced at 100-meter intervals along shorelines\nlonger than 5 kilometers, as mapped by OpenStreetMap.\n\nThe GCTR dataset includes a range of coastal features, such as intersection distances to\nthe OpenStreetMap coastline at bearings from 0 to 360 degrees, along with data from\nERA5 and Overture sources. Each transect extends a defined distance from the generalized\nOpenStreetMap coastline, providing a standardized alongshore resolution. This repository offers\na comprehensive framework for mapping coastal features and deriving coastal statistics globally.\n",
