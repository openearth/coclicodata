  "description": "The Global Coastal Transect Repository (GCTR) consists of ~11.5 million transects (GCTS) with a diverse array of coastal features. These features include intersection distances to the OpenStreetMap coastline at bearings ranging from 0 to 360 degrees; and data from ERA5 and Overture sources. Each transect extends 2000 meters, originating from a generalized OpenStreetMap coastline (as of 2023-02-09) at a zoom level of 9. Transects are positioned at regular intervals of 100 meters, providing a consistent alongshore resolution.",
