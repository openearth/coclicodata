  "description": "\nThe Global Coastal Transect Repository (GCTR) is a comprehensive dataset designed for global\ncoastal analytics. It builds on the Global Coastal Transect System (GCTS), which provides\nover 11 million cross-shore transects uniformly spaced at 100-m intervals. These transects\nserve as standardized reference lines for measuring coastal change, mapping characteristics,\nand deriving coastal statistics thereof. See \"Calkoen et al. (2025) Enabling coastal analytics\nat Planetary scale\" for more information.\n\nThe GCTR dataset includes derived attributes such as intersection distances to OSM coastlines\nat multiple bearings (e.g., 0°, 30°, 330°) and integrates shoreline change rates\nderived from the ShorelineMonitor's Satellite-Derived Shorelines (SDS). See Luijendijk et al.\n(2018) for more information.\n\n",
