The 'coastline_id' corresponds to the FID in OpenStreetMap (OSM) and is prefixed with 'cl'. The 'segment_id' indicates the segment of the OSM coastline split by a UTM grid, prefixed with 's'. The 'interpolated_distance' represents the distance from the starting point of the coastline to the transect, interpolated along the segment, and is prefixed with 'tr'. The complete structure is 'cl[coastline_id]s[segment_id]tr[interpolated_distance]', exemplified by 'cl32946s04tr08168547'. This composition ensures each transect name is a distinct and informative representation of its geographical and spatial attributes."
