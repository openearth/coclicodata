  "description": "We determine efficient coastal adaptation pathways for each coastal floodplain management unit at the European coastline based on a dynamic (inter-temporal) cost-benefit analysis. Protection, retreat and accommodation are considered as potential adaptation options; the height of a protection measure and the retreat height under which all people and assets retreat are determined by the optimisation. Accommodation is binary; buildings can be flood-proofed by up to an extreme event of one meter. The output of this cost-benefit analysis are the most cost-efficient adaptation trajectories, including adaptation options and their height per time step for each floodplain. We further provide the expected residual flood damages and adaptation costs in US$2024. This could be useful to coastal decision-makers to initiate coastal adaptation processes and for global institutions to estimate costs on coastal adaptation on global scale. It is used for a publication that will be send to Nature Climate Change. The files 'GCF.open.CBA_country.SSP245' included aggregated information based on the detailed trajectories on country level. The ending 'SSP126' defines the shared socioeconomic pathway that was used. The variables are the following: country (country name), nuts (EU NUTS two letter code), coast_length (coast length of that country in our model in km), protection_2050 (proportion of the entire coastline of that country where protection is efficient in the year 2050), retreat_2050 (proportion of the entire coastline of that country where retreat is efficient in the year 2050), acc_2050 (proportion of the entire coastline of that country where accommodation is efficient in the year 2050), protection_retreat_2050 (proportion of the entire coastline of that country where protection&retreat simultaneously is efficient in the year 2050), no_adaptation_2050 (proportion of the entire coastline of that country where no adaptation is efficient in the year 2050),     costs_adaptation (the costs for implementing and maintaining adaptation options over the entire time horizon from 2020-2150), costs_damage (the costs for (residual) flood damage over the entire time horizon from 2020-2150), costs= costs_adaptation + costs_damage The files 'GCF.open.CBA.SSP126' contain the detailed adaptation trajectories for each floodplain and all time steps. The ending SSP126 defines the shared socioeconomic pathway that was used. The variables are the following: fpid (ID of each floodplain), year (year), protection_height (efficient protection height for specific floodplain and year), protection_level (return period of this protection height), retreat_height (efficient retreat height for specific floodplain and year), accommodation (efficient binary indicator for accommodation for specific floodplain and year), total_costs (= total_adaptation_costs + total_flood_damages), total_adaptation_costs (adaptation costs, including maintenance, for this floodplain under the efficient adaptation trajectory for year x until 2150), total_flood_damages (flood damages for this floodplain under the efficient adaptation trajectory for year x until 2150), current_adaptation_cost (adaptation costs for this floodplain under the efficient adaptation trajectory at specific year x), annual_flood_damage (flood damage for this floodplain under the efficient adaptation trajectory at specific year x)",
